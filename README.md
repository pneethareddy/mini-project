In today's digital world, data security is of supreme importance. Encryptionplaysa vital role in protecting confidential 
information from unauthorized access.This paperintroduces a novel hybrid encryption algorithm that combines the strengths 
of RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and the Caesar cipher to enhance data security andavoidintrusions. Although the Caesar cipher 
is well known for its simplicity and efficiencyit isvulnerable to frequency analysis attack, dictionary attack and brute 
force attack. Toprevail over these vulnerabilities, we are proposing a hybrid encryption algorithminwhich the data is 
initially encrypted using the Caesar cipher. Following, the Caesarcipher's encrypted plaintext is encrypted using RSA, 
applying its asymmetric-keyencryption capabilities. This two-step encryption or double encryption process createsabalanced
approach that is both efficient and secure. We evaluate the effectiveness of ourproposed algorithm and demonstrate its 
resistance to the attacks. The results demonstratethat the hybrid algorithm enhances the security of the encryption 
process and preventstheknown attacks. This paper describes the use of hybrid encryption techniques toprovidesecurity 
for confidential data. Keywords:- Encryption, RSA, Caesar Cipher, Frequency analysis attack, Data security
